Now:
Whenever pin is tapped, the App searches in Flickr for photos. If the photos have been downloaded before, they will be fetched from the disk instead.

We want:
When a pin is tapped, its associated photo list is checked. If the photo list is empty, the current implementation is used.
If the photo list is not empty, populate the collection view with the photos.

Implementation:
1. saves photos to Photo entity [DONE]
2. try to fetch them before download.[DONE]
